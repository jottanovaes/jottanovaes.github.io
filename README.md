# Jotta Novaes | Portfolio

Welcome to my web space repo!

Currently hosted at [jottanovaes.github.io](https://jottanovaes.github.io), this project acts as my base on the internet. In the future, it will get a new home at **jotta.dev**.

## What is this project?

I created this repo to share my professional and personal interests. The main focus is **programming and technology**, but with the freedom to post as a personal blog.

## What I hope you will find here:
* **Code and Projects:** What I am building and experimenting with in web development.
* **Learning Diary:** Notes, articles, and thoughts on the technologies I'm studying.
* **Worldview:** A free space to share photos, ideas, inspirations, and things I find interesting in my daily life.

## 🚀 Next Steps (Roadmap)
- [x] Deploy the first static version of the site (Base portfolio).
- [ ] Create the feed/blog section for short posts and photos.
- [ ] Configure and migrate to the custom domain `jotta.dev`.

*Built to practice, document, and share.*
